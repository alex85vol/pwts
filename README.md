# Playwright & TypeScript Framework

This repository contains a test automation framework built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The framework is designed for end-to-end testing of web applications.

---

## Features

- **End-to-End Testing**: Write and run tests for web applications using Playwright.
- **TypeScript Support**: Leverage TypeScript's type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed HTML reports for test runs.
- **Trace Viewer**: Debug tests with Playwrightâ€™s trace viewer.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A modern code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---

## Installation

  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
     cd your-repo-name
  2. Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
## Configuration
Update the playwright.config.ts file for your specific needs. For example, set the browsers, test directory, or base URL.

Example playwright.config.ts:

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 1,
  reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }]],
  use: {
    headless: true,
    baseURL: 'https://example.com',
    screenshot: 'on',
    video: 'on',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
});
```

## Running Tests
   Run all tests:
   ```
    npx playwright test
   ``` 
   
   Run tests in a specific file:
   ```
    npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
   ```
  Debug tests:
   ```
    npx playwright test --debug
   ```
## Generate an HTML report:
```
  npx playwright show-report
```
## Folder Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                # Test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.spec.ts   # Example test file
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Ignored files
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts  # Playwright configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
```
## Writing Tests
Create test files in the tests/ directory with the .spec.ts extension. Hereâ€™s an example:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('Example test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example Domain/);
  await page.click('text=More information');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/iana\.org/);
});
```
## Reporting
After running tests, generate an HTML report with:
```
npx playwright show-report
```
Reports will be stored in the playwright-report/ directory.

## Debugging
Use --debug to run tests in debug mode.
View traces by running:
```
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```
